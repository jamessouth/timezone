# timezones

#### React, Node, GraphQL, MongoDB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Query the DB:

```
    by offset from UTC to get places in that time zone (option: with flag)

       OR

    by place name to get time zones spanned by that location
```

TODO:

1.  Check query results against source table on Wikipedia
2.  Mutation idea: accept visitor input of at least their location, add to DB, allow visitor info to be returned in the other queries
